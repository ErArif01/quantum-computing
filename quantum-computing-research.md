## Qubits:
      Qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information. Unlike classical bits that can only be in a state or 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of both states sumultaneously, sllowing quantum computers to perform certain calculations much more efficiently than classical computers.


## Quantum Getes and Circuts:

      Quantum computers use quantum gates to perform operations on qubits. These gates manipulate the quantum state of the qubits, and quantum circuits are constructed by combining these gates to perform specific quantum algorithms.
